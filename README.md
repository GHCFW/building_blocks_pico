# Little Board, Big Possibilities: Exploring Raspberry Pi Pico

Welcome to the exciting world of hardware and firmware using Raspberry Pi Pico!

In this hands-on adventure, weâ€™ll dive into the basics of coding and hardware interactions with the Raspberry Pi Pico. You'll learn how to program simple, yet powerful, actions like blinking a LED, and play a fun game on the board.


## Activity 1: Play the reaction game on the Pico board

  **Goal of the game**<br>
    This is a game of quick reflexes! <br>
  * It is a 2-player game, create groups of 2 on your table. <br>
  * The on-board LED turns on and off as the stimulus. <br>
  * The first player to press their button as soon as the LED goes off wins! <br>
  * A victory music will play for the winning player. <br>
  * The LED has been configured to stay on for an arbitary amount of time. Button presses while the LED is still on will be ignored. <br> <br>

   The Raspberry Pi Pico board has been setup to run with 2 buttons to play. All the necessary code (Micropython firmware, game firmware) has been flashed on the board. You will need to connect the buttons and the buzzer to the board before you can start playing!

 ## Activity 2: Blink an LED on Wokwi simulator 

   **Goal of the exercise**<br>
   * Create a circuit consisting of a LED, a resistor and the Pico board
   * Write firmware to make the LED blink
